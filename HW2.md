[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was the navigation bar. Out of all of the parts of the assignment, the navigation bar was my most favorite and interesting because I went from having a vertical list of the menu items to a horizontal one, with Profile on the very right side. I also enjoyed learning about the horizontal max width and centering the contents on the page.

The hardest thing in this assignment was figuring out how to space everything correctly and whether or not the code I was writing was semantic or not. At some parts of the CSS, I feel like I could have done the spacing a few different ways but I was unsure of the right way to do it. I also am unsure with how the graders want my code to look like. It's kind of weird that it's up to us to code these websites, we are given no general format or structure, and yet the graders mark us off for things I did not even know I needed to do.
