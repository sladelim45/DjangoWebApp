[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how view.py, urls.py, and the templates communicate with each other. This was my first time learning about actually having a backend database which was really fun. Although it was a little of a struggle, overall, I enjoyed it a lot.

The hardest thing in this assignment was figuring out how to extract the data using queries and in what form to give them to the templates. The one I had the most trouble with was the profile. I ended up passing a dictionary as the value that contained the assignment and its counts. Then in the HTML I looped through the dictionary and accessed each item respectively.
