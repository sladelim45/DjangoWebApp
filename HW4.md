[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was connecting NGINX with my django project and linking it to my hostname that I purchased. Since this is my first time doing it, I appireciated the step-by-step process explaning what to do and why to do it.

The hardest thing in this assignment was getting my assignments to show up on the NGINX website. At first I was getting errors loading the whole web page so I ran the migrate command. Then, the webpage loaded but none of the assignments showed up. I had to run the makemigrations, remove dbsqlite.3 and makedate.py again and then it worked.
