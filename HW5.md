[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was creating different views for different users, and specifiying
specific pages to required a login. I also enjoyed learning about how each student can make a change that each ta can view.

The hardest thing in this assignment was getting the submissions to view. There was little instruction about the uploads
folder, and I had to refer to the discord. I ended up recreating the data and all of a suddent it created an uploads folder
for me, which then allowed me to open the submission for each student.
