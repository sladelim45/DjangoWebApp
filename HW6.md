[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was linking the html templates to a 
javascript file and being able to pass in html elements that are modified within the javascript file.
I feel this is a very important skill to know when devleoping websites that deal with user inputting data
because it allows us to deal with their inputs and change what they seen accordingly.

The hardest thing in this assignment was debugging what elements I was selecting and their values. They way I
did it was I made a change in main.js, reran the server, opened it in a web browser, and looked at inspect element,
along with console.log prints of the element to see if it was the correct one.
